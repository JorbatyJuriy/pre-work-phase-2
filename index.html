<h1>The Best Movies According to Juriy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Pirates of the Caribean Sea: Trilogy</h3>
<p>One of the best pirates fantasy movies of all time, specially first 3 movies</p>

<h3>Hacksaw Bridge</h3>
<p>War is always pain. Thats why showing it properly it always hard task for actors and producers.</p>
<p>This fil showing it with all amount of emotions soldier can fell during war. Best war movie i`ve ever seen</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Space always fascinated peoples mind. A lot of scientists `ve been curious about what is beyond what human eye can see</p>
<p>But all hopes crushed after invention of telescope. Space - dark , everlasting dark. That`s why showing films about space
it`s always hard way to entertain humans, but this particular film did it the best way possible </p>
